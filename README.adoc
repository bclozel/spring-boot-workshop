= Spring Boot Workshop

This workshop requires:

* git
* maven 3.2+
* JDK6+ (JDK8 if you want to have fun with lambdas)
* optional: Tomcat 8 if you want to deploy a Spring Boot war application

Note that Spring Boot itself also works with Gradle 1.12.

The slides of the session are https://speakerdeck.com/bclozel/[available on speakerdeck].

The provided applications are:

* `workshop`: main application we'll work on (web, jpa, rest repositories, security, actuator)
* `command-line` and `hello-service-auto-configuration`: showcase of a custom Spring Boot auto-configuration
* `my-webapp`: example web app that can be deployed in a Servlet 3+ container.

The following command (or the equivalent IDE command) you get the required dependencies:

    $ mvn clean package

You can check out at any time a branch that will bring you up to speed with the current step, with `stepX` the name
of the step you want to be in (i.e. step is completed and you're ready to work on the next one):

    $ git reset origin/stepX --hard

== Part #1 :: Booting sequence

In this part, we'll start from a simple skeleton application we've created with the http://start.spring.io service.
This is the workshop app.

=== Step #1 - run and test a simple REST service

Go to the workshop app and run it:
* in your IDE with the "run as main" command
* in your terminal with `mvn spring-boot:run`

Look at the startup logs and go to http://localhost:8080

Create a new REST Controller that returns `Hello World!` on the `"/"` endpoint. For this, you can use the
`@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` annotations.

Restart the application and browse to the endpoint.

Now create an integration test for this controller; this test class should:
* be annotated `@WebIntegrationTest` and ask for a random port
* inject that port as an attribute, using the `@Value` annotation and the following SpEL expression `"${local.server.port}"`
* use a `RestTemplate` to query that endpoint and check that it responds with "Hello World!"

Now, update your REST Controller to make the "World!" part configurable:
* use again `@Value` and a SpEL expr. such as `${conference.name:SpringOne2GX}` on an attribute
* use that attribute in the controller action

Update your test and try the application again.

Add a `conference.name` property in your `application.properties` files and run the app.

Now package the app and try running it as a JAR app:

    $ mvn clean package
    $ java -jar target/workshop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --conference.name="SpringIO"

=== Step #2 - persist data in a datastore


=== Step #3 - Secure your application
